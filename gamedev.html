  <p>
    I like to create games inside of roblox, it's a hobbie of mine which I like to do in my spare time.
    I use Lua to create scripts for the games in order for them to operate. I also create many recreations
    of popular games such as Jailbreak (it is allowed by the developers).
    being a game developer isnt easy as a lot of bugs and gliches occur post poning a lot of things that 
    were promised to be added to the said game, but i never gave up and still kept trying which shows i am 
    very determined.

      This is for an upcoming horror game i am building/coding for a friend.   <br>
      I created it inside of roblox studio using the building tools that it provides.  <br>
      I am also helping code the game too using lua (the programing language roblox uses) to make  <br>
     things actually work like jumpscares and other scary stuff.<br>

  <br> This is my code that i made for my jailbreak recreations. i scripted it using lua, 
  <br>this was to create every bit such as the vehicles, robberies and even how the player moves like punching crawling etc
  <br> and even storing cash that the player gets out of the doing different tasks inside of the game.<br>

 <br>
This is the map that i created to be as accurate as ever , similar to the horror game i am
<br> making, i used the  different tools 
that roblox offers in order to recreate it 1:1. <br>
this was things like editing the light which was hard 
<br>however a lot of differnt tools such as decompiling the game made<br>
it possible for an accurate lighting to the original to be made.<br>
