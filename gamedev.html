  <p>
    I like to create games inside of Roblox, it's a hobby of mine which I like to do in my spare time.
    I use Lua to create scripts for the games for them to operate. I also create many recreations
    of popular games such as Jailbreak (it is allowed by the developers).
    Being a game developer isnâ€™t easy as a lot of bugs and glitches occur postponing a lot of things that 
    were promised to be added to the said game, but I never gave up and kept trying which shows I am 
    very determined.

     This is for an upcoming horror game I am building/coding for a friend.   <br>
      I created it inside of Roblox studio using the building tools that the software provides.  <br>
      I am also helping code the game too using Lua(the programming language Roblox uses) to make  <br>
     things work like jump scares and other scary stuff.<br>

     <br>  


 <br> This is my code that I made for my jailbreak recreations. I scripted it using Lua 
  <br>this was to create every bit such as the vehicles, robberies and even how the player moves like punching crawling etc
  <br> and even storing cash that the player gets out of the doing different tasks inside of the game.<br>

 <br>
This is the map that I created to be as accurate as ever, like the horror game i am
<br> making, I used the different tools 
that Roblox offers to recreate it 1:1. <br>
this was things like editing the light which was hard 
<br>however a lot of different tools such as decompiling the game made<br>
it possible for an accurate lighting to the original to be made.<br>
