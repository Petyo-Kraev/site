        <h3> In my IT course we did a section on PC Workshop. This part of the course consisted of both practical and theory <br>
        like researching and learning a new programming language called C# (CSharp). CSharp is a programming language for the .Net platform,
         which is specialises
      in software like video games, and mobile apps. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We also learned about the different components of desktop computers, such as where they are located inside of the computer case and what 
      each part does and how it operates. We had certain lessons dedicated to disassemble computers and look each part individually, and explained what
      each part did , and them reassembled it back to a working state. We were also tasked to install and operating syste onto those computers, operating systems like
      Windows 10 or Linux Mint.
